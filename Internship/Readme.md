# **Internship Report**

### Name - *Tanishq Homkar*
### Project  - *Learn to Build Real-Time Google Play Store Data Analytics - Python*

## Introduction

This report outlines my experience and accomplishments during my internship, where I focused on analyzing Google Play Store data and user reviews using Python. The goal was to perform comprehensive exploratory data analysis and derive meaningful insights using sentiment mining techniques.

## Background

The internship project aimed to uncover patterns in app data and understand user sentiment through review analysis. This involved cleaning and preprocessing raw datasets, conducting data exploration, and applying sentiment analysis tools to classify user reviews. The project was an opportunity to strengthen my data science skills using Python libraries like pandas, Plotly, and nltk.

## Learning Objectives

- Utilize Python for data cleaning, transformation, and exploration.
- Perform sentiment analysis using VADER from the nltk library.
- Create interactive visualizations using Plotly.
- Analyze trends in app popularity, ratings, and user feedback.
- Derive actionable insights from structured and unstructured data.

## Activities and Tasks

I successfully completed the following key tasks during the internship:

- **Data Loading and Wrangling:**
Loaded two datasets: app metadata and user reviews. Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Analyzed app distribution by category, ratings, install count, and pricing. Identified trends and patterns in the data.

- **Sentiment Analysis:**
Applied VADER sentiment analyzer from nltk to classify user reviews into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments. Merged review sentiments with app metadata for further insights.

- **Visualizations:**
Built interactive visualizations using Plotly to explore app ratings, sentiment distribution, and category-based performance.

## Skills and Competencies

- **Data Analysis and Wrangling:** Used Python (pandas, numpy) to clean, merge, and manipulate datasets.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Applied rule-based sentiment scoring using VADER.
- **Data Visualization:** Created informative, interactive plots with Plotly Express.
- **Text Processing:** Parsed and analyzed user reviews for polarity detection.
- **Critical Thinking:** Interpreted patterns and anomalies in app performance and user feedback.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Data Inconsistency:**
Challenge: Presence of missing and inconsistent values.
Solution: Implemented data cleaning functions to normalize and fill or drop missing data.

- **Sentiment Ambiguity:**
Challenge: VADER sometimes struggled with sarcasm and ambiguous language.
Solution: Focused on review volume and average sentiment to counteract individual misclassifications.

- **Data Volume:**
Challenge: Processing large datasets affected performance.
Solution: Optimized code and leveraged vectorized operations for efficiency.

## Outcomes and Impact

This internship enhanced my practical knowledge of data science workflows. I learned to clean and transform raw datasets, apply sentiment analysis techniques, and build interactive visualizations. These skills have equipped me for future roles involving data analytics, visualization, and natural language processing.

## Conclusion

The internship was a valuable learning journey that allowed me to apply Python-based tools for real-world data analysis. Working with app and user review data gave me a holistic view of both structured and unstructured analysis. This experience forms a strong foundation for my aspirations in the data science and analytics domain.
